# Go TUI Framework Research for CCManager

## Executive Summary

Based on extensive research of Go TUI frameworks in 2024, **Bubble Tea** by Charm is the recommended framework for building an interactive menu-driven application. It offers modern architecture, excellent documentation, and a robust ecosystem of components.

## Top Go TUI Frameworks Comparison

### 1. **Bubble Tea** (Recommended) ⭐️
- **Repository**: github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea
- **Architecture**: Model-View-Update (inspired by Elm)
- **Status**: Actively maintained, production-ready
- **Community**: Large, active community with extensive examples

#### Key Features:
- **Modern Architecture**: Clean separation of state management, updates, and rendering
- **Component Library**: Extensive collection via `charmbracelet/bubbles`
- **Styling**: Beautiful terminal styling with `charmbracelet/lipgloss`
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Built-in support for custom key bindings
- **Session Management**: State-based architecture makes session management straightforward
- **Mouse Support**: Full mouse interaction support

#### Pros:
- Familiar architecture for web developers (similar to React/Elm)
- Excellent documentation and tutorials
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Strong ecosystem with pre-built components
- Used by many production applications

#### Cons:
- Requires understanding of Elm architecture
- String-based rendering (need to construct UI as strings)
- Manual handling of SIGINT/SIGQUIT signals
- Avoid using goroutines directly (use framework commands instead)

#### Example Structure:
```go
type model struct {
    choices  []string
    cursor   int
    selected map[int]struct{}
}

func (m model) Init() tea.Cmd {
    return nil
}

func (m model) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {
    // Handle keyboard input, mouse events, etc.
}

func (m model) View() string {
    // Render the UI
}
```

### 2. **tview** (Strong Alternative)
- **Repository**: github.com/rivo/tview
- **Architecture**: Widget-based
- **Status**: Mature, stable, production-ready
- **Used by**: K9s, lazydocker, and other popular tools

#### Key Features:
- **Rich Widget Set**: Forms, lists, text areas, grids, tables
- **Built on tcell**: Low-level terminal control
- **Mouse Support**: Full mouse interaction
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Built-in support for navigation keys
- **Colors & Styling**: Support for colors, bold, italic, etc.

#### Pros:
- Traditional widget-based approach
- Extensive pre-built components
- Good documentation with examples
- Simpler for basic form-based UIs
- Cross-platform support

#### Cons:
- Less flexible than Bubble Tea for custom UIs
- Widget-based approach can be limiting
- Less modern architecture

#### Example:
```go
app := tview.NewApplication()
list := tview.NewList().
    AddItem("Option 1", "Description 1", '1', nil).
    AddItem("Option 2", "Description 2", '2', nil)
if err := app.SetRoot(list, true).Run(); err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```

### 3. **gocui** (Minimalist)
- **Repository**: github.com/jroimartin/gocui
- **Architecture**: View-based with manual layout
- **Status**: Stable but less actively maintained

#### Features:
- Minimalist approach
- Full control over layout
- Good for custom UIs
- Keyboard and mouse support

#### Cons:
- Most widgets need to be written from scratch
- Steeper learning curve
- Less documentation

### 4. **termui** (Dashboard-focused)
- **Repository**: github.com/gizak/termui
- **Architecture**: Block-based with grid layout
- **Best for**: Dashboards and data visualization

#### Features:
- Built-in charts and graphs
- Grid-based layout system
- Good for monitoring applications

#### Cons:
- Less suitable for interactive menus
- More focused on data visualization

### 5. **tui-go** (Deprecated)
- **Status**: No longer maintained
- **Note**: Author recommends using tview instead

## Recommendation for CCManager

**Primary Choice: Bubble Tea**

For building an interactive menu-driven application like CCManager, Bubble Tea is the recommended framework because:

1. **Modern Architecture**: The Model-View-Update pattern is perfect for managing complex application state and session management
2. **Flexibility**: Can create custom, beautiful UIs that match your exact needs
3. **Ecosystem**: Bubbles components provide ready-to-use menus, lists, inputs, and more
4. **Keyboard Support**: Excellent support for custom keyboard shortcuts and navigation
5. **Future-proof**: Most actively developed framework with growing community

**Alternative: tview**

If you prefer a more traditional approach or need to prototype quickly, tview is an excellent alternative with:
- Pre-built menu and list widgets
- Simpler API for basic applications
- Proven track record (used by K9s)

## Getting Started

### With Bubble Tea:
```bash
go get github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea
go get github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles
go get github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss
```

### With tview:
```bash
go get github.com/rivo/tview
```

## Session Management Strategies

For CCManager's session management needs:

### Bubble Tea Approach:
- Use the model to store session state
- Implement session switching in the Update function
- Create custom commands for session operations
- Use tea.Batch for concurrent operations

### tview Approach:
- Use application pages for different views
- Store session data in application context
- Switch between pages for different sessions
- Use callbacks for session operations
